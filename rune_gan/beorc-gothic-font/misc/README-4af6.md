# Beorc Gothic runic fonts

Beorc Gothic is a new runic typeface intended for legibility of running text. The design departs noticeably from the historical rune forms, using large numbers of rounded strokes where the runes traditionally used sharply angled zig-zags. Beorc Gothic takes cues from a number of modern typefaces for the Latin script, employing wider glyphs than most runic typeface designs, exaggerated differences between similar-looking runes, and a rough runic equivalent to the large x-height found in many sans-serif screen fonts.
